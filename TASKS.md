# Code Review Recommendations

Here is a list of recommendations from the code review, from most important to least important.

1.  **Unsafe Code and Memory Management:** The manual memory management of the `Window` struct is the biggest risk in this codebase. While the current implementation seems correct, it's very fragile. A small mistake could lead to memory leaks or undefined behavior.
    *   **Recommendation:** Explore using a crate like `winit` for window creation and event handling. This would eliminate the need for most of the `unsafe` code and manual memory management.

2.  **Hardcoded values:** In `src/core/event/key_id.rs`, the virtual key codes are hardcoded. It would be better to use the constants from the `windows` crate if they are available. For example, `windows::Win32::UI::Input::KeyboardAndMouse::VK_A`.

3.  **Redundant `new` and `default`:** In several places, there is a `new` function and a `Default` implementation that do the same thing. The `new` function could be removed in favor of `Default::default()`.

4.  **Error Handling:** The error handling is generally good, but there are a few places where `unwrap()` or `expect()` could be used instead of `?`. For example, in `examples/hello_world.rs`, the `build` method returns a `Result`, but it's not handled.
