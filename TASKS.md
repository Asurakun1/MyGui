## Future Enhancements

  - **Idea**: Reorganize the project into a Cargo workspace to improve modularity and compile times.
  - **Plan**:
    - Create a `crates` directory.
    - Create individual crates for `backend`, `event`, `platform`, `render`, and `window`.
    - Move the existing code from `src/core` into the new crates.
    - Update the main `Cargo.toml` to define the workspace.
    - Update the main `my_gui` library to act as a facade, re-exporting the components from the new crates.

- **Layout System**:
  - **Idea**: Introduce a layout system to manage the positioning and sizing of UI elements automatically, instead of relying on hardcoded coordinates.
  - **Discussion Points**:
    - Should we use a container-based model (e.g., `VBox`, `HBox`, `Grid`)?
    - How should the layout system interact with the `Scene` and `Drawable` objects?
    - How will it handle window resizing and dynamic content?

- **Widget System**:
  - **Idea**: Define a `Widget` trait that unifies appearance, behavior, and layout.
  - **Discussion Points**:
    - A widget is a self-contained component that manages a specific region of the screen.
    - **Appearance (Drawing)**: A widget needs to be `Drawable` and will use a `Canvas` for its drawing surface and local coordinate system.
    - **Behavior (Event Handling)**: A widget must be able to receive events, perform hit-testing to see if the event is within its bounds, manage its own state, and emit actions.
    - **Layout (Sizing and Positioning)**: A widget needs to be able to report its preferred size and adapt to the constraints given to it by a parent layout container.
    - **Composition**: Widgets can be composed of other widgets.

- **Cross-Platform Support**:
  - **Idea**: Add support for macOS (using Metal/Cocoa) and Linux (using Vulkan/Wayland).
  - **Discussion Points**:
    - The abstraction layer is in place, but new backends will need to be created for each platform.
    - This will involve creating new implementations of the `WindowBackend`, `Renderer`, and `EventLoopBackend` traits.

- **Advanced State Management**:
  - **Idea**: Explore more advanced state management patterns for complex applications.
  - **Discussion Points**:
    - For more complex applications, the current approach of passing the entire `app` state around could become cumbersome.
    - Research and consider patterns like Entity-Component-System (ECS) or other state management libraries.
