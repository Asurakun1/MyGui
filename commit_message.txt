refactor: Decouple event loop from Win32 API

This commit decouples the event loop from the Win32 API by introducing a
`PlatformEventLoop` trait. The `Win32EventLoop` provides the
platform-specific implementation for Windows.

The `Window::run` method now creates and runs the event loop, while the
`WindowBackend` is no longer responsible for the message loop.
