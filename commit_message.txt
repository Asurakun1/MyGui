refactor: Decouple event loop from windowing system

This commit decouples the event loop from the windowing system by
introducing a `PlatformEventLoop` trait. The `Win32EventLoop` provides
the platform-specific implementation for Windows.

The `Window` struct no longer has a `run` method. Instead, the
application is responsible for creating and running the `EventLoop`.
