feat: Standardize API and configuration

This commit standardizes the API and configuration of the framework by:

1.  Changing the `with_title` and `with_font_face_name` methods in
    `WindowBuilder` to use `impl Into<String>` for a more flexible API.
2.  Moving the font settings from `WindowConfig` into a dedicated
    `FontConfig` struct within `RendererConfig`.
